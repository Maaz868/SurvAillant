## How to Build and Run

1. **Setup Hardware and Network:**
   - Connect real motors, sensors, and PLCs.
   - Set up the Ignition platform for supervisory control.
   - Integrate Node-RED for PLC programming.

2. **Capture and Analyze Packets:**
   - Use Wireshark to capture communication packets between supervisory control and PLCs.
   - Save the captured packets in a suitable format for further processing.

3. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Use Python scripts with libraries like NumPy and Pandas to convert packet data into CSV format.
   - Extract relevant features for training machine learning models.

4. **Train Machine Learning Models:**
   - Train the Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and One-Class SVM models on the extracted features.
   - Validate and optimize the models for accurate anomaly detection.

5. **Deploy Models:**
   - Deploy the trained models to monitor real-time communication between supervisory control and PLCs.
   - Implement the models to detect anomalies and potential security threats.

6. **Setup Django Web Portal:**
   - Install Django and set up the web portal.
   - Integrate the notification system to alert users of detected threats.
   - Ensure the web portal provides real-time updates and an intuitive interface for monitoring.

7. **Project Management with Jira:**
   - Use Jira to track project progress and manage tasks.
   - Collaborate with team members and ensure timely completion of milestones.

8. **Monitor and Maintain:**
   - Continuously monitor the system for potential threats.
   - Regularly update models and features to adapt to new security challenges.
   - Maintain the hardware and software components to ensure seamless operation.
